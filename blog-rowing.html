                    The 5th "Tinmuk Cup" Hengqin Rowing Regatta 2025 -- HKUST mixed 8+ (I'm the second crew from the
                    back).

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanfang Daily</a>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The pressure of looming deadlines—sharpened by the heavy atmosphere after the Tai Po inferno—sat on my
                chest.
                Still, I put the anxiety aside and boarded the bus to Hengqin with the HKUST rowing team members. As we pulled
                away,
                the sunset outside the window felt like a quiet send-off, wishing us good luck. We had no clear
                expectations
                of how we would measure up against international crews, and I couldn’t stop replaying the cracks exposed
                in
                training: Would we stay perfectly synchronized at high stroke rates? If the wind rose, could we keep the
                boat
                balanced? My teammates smiled and reassured me: we’ll just do our best and enjoy the race. Even so, tension
                hung in
                the air while our coxswain carefully walked through the planned calls for the heat.</p>

            <p>The minutes before the start were chaotic. Later, Sharon pointed out that some of the confusion was on
                Juni
                and me. But once we were off, our start was clean and powerful. We moved ahead quickly, leaving the
                Cambridge
                &amp; Oxford crew and Peking University behind us—my first time feeling our boat take the lead right
                from
                the opening strokes. The wind and spray swallowed Yoyo’s voice, and my mind went blank in the best way.
                I
                narrowed my world to one job: follow No. 8—catch, drive, finish, recover; square the blade. Movements we
                had
                repeated thousands of times returned as instinct. Midway through, the handle suddenly felt heavier, as
                if the
                water itself thickened. Even with the other boats fading behind, I couldn’t unclench. I held on tighter
                and
                locked the blade into the water. Then the horn cut through everything: we had crossed the finish line.
                We won.</p>

            <p>The heat broke the long spell of gloom I’d been carrying. After a short rest, we cheered for other teams
                under
                another brilliant sunset. Kites drifted above the course, and the last light rinsed everyone’s faces. In
                the
                evening breeze, we watched performances from different universities, and without warning my eyes
                stung—this was
                the community I loved, the place I felt I belonged. Whatever happened the next day, we had already
                earned a
                story worth keeping: we had outrun the tall, powerful Cambridge and Oxford crew.</p>

            <p>By the next morning my hands had stopped shaking, but my body was nowhere near ready for another all-out
                race.
                The sudden schedule change cut our sleep, and it rattled everyone. Still, we adapted and threw ourselves
                back
                into preparation. Our captain adjusted the sprint technique—shifting from half-slide strokes to not
                leaning back—something some of us had barely practiced. When we finally lined up in our lane, Sharon
                shouted “Attention!” and before some of us even registered the signal, the race was already on. I tried
                to do
                what Austin had taught me: picture the blade, sit tall, eyes forward. We stayed tightly in the chase. At
                first,
                the Malaysian and Tongji boats sounded close beside us, but then we began to drift—dangerously—toward
                the
                Malaysian team’s lane. The umpire whipped the white flag. Yoyo yelled, “Stroke side harder!” I pushed,
                but my
                legs had nothing left to give. We clawed our way back into our lane. Even when it was clear we no longer
                had a
                real shot at winning, every one of us kept pulling with whatever remained.</p>

            <p>One horn, then another. A few seconds later we crossed the finish line—just a few seconds behind. I saw
                Steven collapse onto
                the boat, letting one leg trail into the water. We were emptied out. We paddled lightly back to the
                pontoon,
                where the Men’s Eight and Terry welcomed us and gently helped bring the boat ashore. We hugged,
                high-fived, and
                kept each other upright with small jokes and quieter encouragement. Underneath it all, though, a thin
                regret
                stayed with me. Since I started rowing last year, this was the first time I truly felt how close we were
                to
                winning. Maybe this is what it means to not want to give up. If I keep rowing, will we win one day? Or
                will my
                height and weight always be something I can’t quite make up for?</p>

            <p>I’ll never know if I give up.</p>

                    2025 Hong Kong Universities Rowing Championships
                    (I am third from the left in the second row).
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>It's the first day of summer without any rowing plan ahead
                and time to write down a reflection about my personal
                reasons behind rowing. To be honest, I chose rowing
                following the bias of my heart and not giving up in
                responsibility for the team. Still, there are some
                rationales to summarize.</p>

            <p>I row not for a medal, but for better learning and working
                status. Committing to a sport requires physical, financial,
                and time investment. Therefore, I was looking for a sport
                with the following qualities to boost cost-efficiency:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety as a Basic Consideration:</strong>
                    Engaging in a sport that minimizes the risk of
                    injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Challenge:</strong> It allows me to
                    continuously challenge myself and develop my skills over
                    the years.</li>
                <li><strong>Morning Training:</strong> Training early in the
                    morning helps me establish a daily routine; waking up
                    early is part of the training discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Background:</strong> It offers a wealth
                    of history and literature to explore, fostering
                    spiritual growth and personal enrichment.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Connection:</strong> It's a social sport
                    that helps me connect with local people and the
                    community.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeting Weaknesses:</strong> Participation
                    highlights my weakest link. Physical fitness involves
                    six attributes: agility, coordination, balance, speed,
                    reaction, and explosiveness. I need to work on improving
                    my agility, which is currently my biggest
                    challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After exploring the available resources in Hong Kong, I
                narrowed down to rowing, windsurfing, and fencing. I crossed
                out "marathon" because I once ran a half marathon, which led
                to a knee injury. I stopped running for several months and
                still have lingering concerns about it. Tennis (it hurts
                when you get hit), rock climbing (easy to fall), and cycling
                (risk of falling at high speeds) were also excluded due to
                my fear of getting injured.</p>

            <h3>Whom I row with matters</h3>

            <p>I started collecting information about people in those sports
                clubs and courses. It is true that different athletes in
                various sports have distinct characteristics. Unfortunately,
                there wasn't much information about windsurfing and fencing
                except for official introductions and professional photos.
                The comparison became unfair at this stage.</p>

            <p>From the photos in HKUST rowing club's Instagram, I saw their
                dark skin, warm and confident smiles, friendly interactions,
                and slightly awkward promotions. Although many of the images
                are rough from a promotional perspective, they highlight
                sincerity and vitality even more. I was immediately
                attracted to the rowing club for its simplicity,
                friendliness, and strong emphasis on team spirit and
                personal growth. (Hopefully I was not just fascinated by how
                cool the rowing girls are.)</p>

            <p>That's the start of my story with rowing.</p>
